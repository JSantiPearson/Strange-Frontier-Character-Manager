This is why they never felt the need to head out into the stars. Grub Tubs like to fight with their hands and use those predatory instincts to their advantage. They are a fast, though not terribly sturdy species, and have speedy cell regeneration.";
const giantLore = "Giants are humans that were taken from Earth to another planet in the Stone Age. They are part of a warrior race that has a culture based on military dogmatism. Ruthlessly efficient and powerful, they are fearsome on the battlefield. Giants are more resilient than their earthling counterparts and develop muscle mass a lot easier. However their bigger size makes them slower and less flexible.";
const vermileLore = "The vermile went down two rather different evolutionary paths. The vermile in the upper city have grown into a culture of peaceful, clean, and friendly mouse people. The vermile in the lower city evolved to be a garbage focused culture of scavengers and scumbags. They are a species that isn't fast or strong but is very clever. Vermile are born negotiators and wickedly intelligent, often knowing when and when not to fight, assuring their own survival.";
const capraLore = "The capra are a race of goat-like people who have a vibrant culture, and along with the Giants, a multi system spanning empire. The Capra have exceptionally flexible limbs making them great at acrobatics and aerial combat. Capra are fast and durable if not on the dumber side, but what they lack in technical knowledge, they make up for in wisdom.";

The ogoloids are, in some ways, the only force of law in the wild crazy fringe that is the Sombrero Galaxy. Ogoloids are stoic and tend to be very orderly, and will go out of their way to create order where none exists. Ogoloids are strong and durable, but not very fast. They have pretty average intellect overall.";

Arachnet tend to be polite and are rather open minded about other cultures, but their society's priority is to unflinchingly serve their own monarchs. Arachnet communicate telepathically, and as a result can automatically translate conversations with other species without the use of a galactic translator.";
const wheepeLore = "Wheepes are a species of sentient plants. They have a thin layer of plant fiber covering their hard outer shell. These fibers closely resemble wheat. The wheepes are a gentle farming race that doesn't tend to fight. Wheepes aren't particularly strong or fast, but they're durable and wise.";
const constructLore = "Construct is the blanket intergalactic term for robots that have been given, or have achieved sentience. Because they are robots, they don't need to eat, sleep, or show mercy. They can be a walking kitchen or an unstoppable weapon of conquest and war - it all depends on who is inside of that sometimes remorseless robot heart. Constructs have physical characteristics that range based on their model, but generally theyâ€™re intelligent and durable.";

These aliens retreated back to their homes in the Sombrero Galaxy where they bred special humans designed to be the perfect slave miners. These humans are called mod-humans. Mod-Humans have since spread all over the Sombrero Galaxy, having no particular place to call home. Mod-Humans are durable, strong and fast.";

The energy absorbed forms a living consciousness, and as it ages, a tangible body of light will grow.";
const simianLore = "The simians are a race of monkey-like people who inhabit the sombrero galaxy. They have opposable thumbs on their feet and hands, and have hair covering most of their body.  Simians pride themselves on having a wide variety of skills. They aren't abnormally quick or strong, but sharp wit makes them great at adapting on the fly.";
